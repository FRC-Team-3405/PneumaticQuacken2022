# PneumaticQuacken2022
This is the fully-functional start-up code for the Quacken this year. 
The drivetrain & shifting mechanisms have been mapped to a joystick (rather than an Xbox controller).
To shift, use buttons 1 (High) and 2 (Low) on the joystick.

Code will be updated periodically as I organize it a little bit more into subsystems and add more functions, such as testing SmartDashboard pushing.
